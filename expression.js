// One of the most common wayus to form expressions in JavaScript is to use operators:
// Operators act on values (the operands) to produce a new value.
// Arithmetic operators are some of the simplest:
3 + 2	// => 5: addition
3 - 2	// => 1: subtraction
3 * 2	// => 6: multiplication
3 / 2	// => 1.5 division
points[1].x - points[0].x	// => 1: more complicated operands also work
